#Advent of Code

This is my repository for the 2018 AdventOfCode challenge. Probably mostly python. Maybe a bit of C++. Also nice to get used to git. The objective is to compelete two stars **\[**]\** on every challenge with the shortest amount of code, while still maintaining clean formatting practices.
